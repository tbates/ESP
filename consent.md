Edinburgh Social Panel Consent Form
Version 1.0

### Consent
The next few screens contain information about Genes for Good and the benefits and risks of participating. This is called "informed consent", because we want you to be informed about the study before you agree to participate.

### About the Study
Edinburgh Social Panel has been reviewed and approved by a University of Edinburgh Ethics committee following UK law. The ethics committee is a group of science and ethics experts who review research studies to help and protect research participants.

Edinburgh Social Panel was created to accelerate understanding of the causes and, where possible, cures for health and behavior. As a member of the panel, you will be asked to participate in surveys about your personality and health and, optionally, take part in studies designed to help people get control over their behavior.

Our research team at the University of Edinburgh will use the information you provide to advance our understanding of behavior and health. The findings from this research may benefit many individuals, for generations to come, as we learn more about how behaviours affect, wealth, society, and ourselves. Where permitted, you will be able to use the data you contribute to track and get feedback on your lifestyle, habits and activities, and see where you sit among other's.

The text below document the information you should understand before you agree to participate. The purpose of this information is to confirm our commitments to you and your agreement to participate in Edinburgh Social Panel.

### Participating. You should understand that:
• Participation is Voluntary: Your participation in the research will last as long as you use the App.
• Survey Questionnaires: We will ask you to complete surveys related to many aspects of your life, including your health, your habits, your attitudes, and your relationships. There are two types of assessments: Health History Surveys that are only meant to be answered once, and short Health Tracking Surveys that can be answered daily or weekly. You can complete any, all, or none of these surveys.
• Saliva Sample: After you complete several Health History Surveys and Health Tracking Surveys you will be eligible to provide a saliva sample. You can find the required number of surveys in the App on the welcome page and on our website (http://genesforgood.sph.umich.edu/participate). Edinburgh Social Panel will send you a mail-in "spit kit" to collect your saliva sample free of charge. Providing a saliva sample is completely voluntary. If you choose to provide a saliva sample we will send you this consent form in hard copy together with the spit kit and ask for your signature. Without this signature we will be unable to process your saliva. If you choose to withdraw from the study we will keep your signed consent form in a locked office. We will obtain genetic information (DNA) from your saliva for research, such as testing genetic variants for association with environmental factors, health and disease information that you and others provided through the surveys. The DNA will be frozen and stored indefinitely in a secure laboratory (a biorepository).
• Contact Information: If you choose to provide a saliva sample, we will require your name and mailing address for shipment, and email address for tracking. We will then mail a spit kit to you. We will under no circumstances release your name, address, or email, or directly link it with any other information you provide.
• Re-Contact: You may be re-contacted. We will occasionally use your Facebook email address to communicate with you. For example, you may be contacted by email to answer additional surveys or provide additional saliva samples for future studies. There is no obligation to participate in these future studies.
• Sharing and Use: Science works best when scientists work together. To achieve this, we will release your DNA and de-identified data to qualified scientists from reputable institutions for further research, under relevant law and with appropriate regulatory approval. Any release of your information will be approved by relevant Institutional Review Boards, which are panels of ethics and science experts who protect research participants.

### Joining.
* Edinburgh Social Panel is a research study.
* You will not receive payment for participation in this project or receive payments from scientific discoveries made using the information or samples you donate.
* You can withdraw from Edinburgh Social Panel at any time. You can stop participating in
the study by using the withdrawal link in the website which can be found under “Your Account” at the upper right corner. Withdrawing is also possible by emailing us at TODO: ourEMAIL, or by calling us at TODO: OURPHONE

After withdrawing we will delete your name and unique ID from our database. We will also remove your addresses (IP address and physical address) and phone number (if you provided them to us). We will keep your age, sex and zip code, and use these limited data for future research; this includes also your DNA, if you have provided a sample.

Only you can remove the Edinburgh Social Panel App from your Facebook account, which you do through your Facebook Account Settings page.

### Return of Information When you provide us with your information, whether survey results or DNA, we believe we have an obligation to return interesting results of our research to you.

**Survey Results**: Edinburgh Social Panel will allow you to view and download the information you provide, and compare it to summaries of the information provided by others.

#### Risks and protections
We will carefully protect all information you provide, including your survey results and genetic information. For example, we will only release your data (untraceable to you) to qualified scientists from reputable institutions, consistent with the norms and regulations of other major research projects. We will never make your data available to the general public.

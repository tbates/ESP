Edinburgh Social Panel Consent Form
Version 1.0

### Consent
The next few screens contain information about Genes for Good and the benefits and risks of participating. This is called "informed consent", because we want you to be informed about the study before you agree to participate.

### About the Study
Edinburgh Social Panel has been reviewed and approved by a University of Edinburgh Ethics committee following UK law. The ethics committee is a group of science and ethics experts who review research studies to help and protect research participants.

Edinburgh Social Panel was created to accelerate understanding of the causes and, where possible, cures for health and behavior. As a member of the panel, you will be asked to participate in surveys about your personality and health and, optionally, take part in studies designed to help people get control over their behavior.

Our research team at the University of Edinburgh will use the information you provide to advance our understanding of behavior and health. The findings from this research may benefit many individuals, for generations to come, as we learn more about how behaviours affect, wealth, society, and ourselves. Where permitted, you will be able to use the data you contribute to track and get feedback on your lifestyle, habits and activities, and see where you sit among other's.

The text below document the information you should understand before you agree to participate. The purpose of this information is to confirm our commitments to you and your agreement to participate in Edinburgh Social Panel.

### Participating. You should understand that:
• Participation is Voluntary: Your participation in the research will last as long as you use the site
• Survey Questionnaires: We will ask you to complete surveys related to many aspects of your life, including your health, your habits, your attitudes, and your relationships. There are two types of assessments: Health History Surveys that are only meant to be answered once, and short Health Tracking Surveys that can be answered daily or weekly. You can complete any, all, or none of these surveys.
• Re-Contact: You may be re-contacted. We will occasionally use your e-mail address to communicate with you. For example, you may be contacted by email to answer additional surveys or provide additional saliva samples for future studies. There is no obligation to participate in these future studies.
• Sharing and Use: Science works best when scientists work together. To achieve this, we will release your de-identified data to qualified scientists from reputable institutions for further research, under relevant law and with appropriate regulatory approval. Any release of your information will be approved by relevant Institutional Review Boards, which are panels of ethics and science experts who protect research participants.

### Joining.

### Return of Information When you provide us with your information, whether survey results or DNA, we believe we have an obligation to return interesting results of our research to you.

**Survey Results**: Edinburgh Social Panel will allow you to view and download the information you provide, and compare it to summaries of the information provided by others.

#### Risks and protections
We will carefully protect all information you provide, including your survey results and genetic information. For example, we will only release your data (untraceable to you) to qualified scientists from reputable institutions, consistent with the norms and regulations of other major research projects.
